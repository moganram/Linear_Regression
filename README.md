# Linear_Regression and Logistic_Regression
Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a
scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent
and independent variables).
Procedure for Linear Regression:
step 1: Import libraries and dataset
Import the important libraries and the dataset we are using to perform Polynomial
Regression.
step 2: Dividing the dataset into 2 components
Divide dataset into two components that is X and y.X will contain the Column
between 1 and 2. y will contain the 2 columns.
step 3: Fitting Linear Regression to the dataset
Fitting the linear Regression model On two components.
step 4: Fitting Polynomial Regression to the dataset
Fitting the Polynomial Regression model on two components X and y.
step 5: In this step, we are Visualising the Linear Regression results using a
scatter plot.
step 6: Visualising the Polynomial Regression results using a scatter plot.
step 7: Predicting new results with both Linear and Polynomial Regression.
Note that the input variable must be in a numpy 2D array.

# Logistic_Regression
Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they
are used. Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas
Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.

Steps in Logistic Regression:
To implement the Logistic Regression using Python, we will use the same steps as
we have done in previous topics of Regression. Below are the steps:

1. Data Pre-processing step
2 .Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
3. Predicting the test result
4. Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)
5 . Visualizing the test set result.
